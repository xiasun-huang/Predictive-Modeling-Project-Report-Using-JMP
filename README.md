# Predictive-Modeling-Project-Report-Using-JMP
Hey, this is my report for the course project of predictive modeling with JMP!

For this project, my team used JMP to analyze heart failure prediction data we found on kaggle.com and generate some business insights based on what we've learned from the data. I'm the one who's responsible for the report drafting and data analysis to the end of the preject.
